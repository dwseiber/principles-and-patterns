# Principles and Patterns

## Purpose

I created this repository to illustrate Uncle Bob's SOLID principles and the Gang of Four's design patterns.  These concepts were not clear to many developers I've worked with, so I created this repository to help.

## Principles

SOLID principles were discovered by Robert C. Martin and turned into a mnemonic acronym by Michael Feathers.  These principles, if followed, are meant to allow a programmer to create a maintanable, extensible system.
